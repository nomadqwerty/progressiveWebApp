                    "title": "This Keurig is My Favorite Kitchen Appliance and It's Well-Worth the Money We Spent!",
                    "body": "***Updates are located at the bottom of this review.***  ***Original Review*** Up until recently, I had never been much of a coffee drinker except for the occasional seasonal flavored latte drinks but I was having trouble keeping up with my very active twin toddlers. We already had a standard coffee maker but I didn't want to brew a whole pot of coffee at once and single-serve coffee makers seem to be very popular so I figured it couldn't hurt to give it a try. I had seen several different Keurigs from the basic ones to very fancy ones but wanted to purchase one that both fulfilled my needs to brew a single cup of coffee and wasn't too expensive so I opted to buy the Keurig K55 Coffee Maker in black.  When the Keurig arrived, I eagerly opened up the box to get it set up and start using it! I found it fairly simple to set up since there is a Use and Care Guide included and it's easy to follow the step-by-step instructions. I'd say the setup only takes a few minutes and then you are ready to brew your first cup of coffee. There are lights on the brewer that illuminate and walk you through the brewing process but once you are used to it, it becomes second nature and now, I don't even have to think about it, which is good in the early morning when I'm not thinking straight and need my coffee!  Brewing: To brew a cup of coffee is very simple. You'll need to turn on the brewer by pushing the power button. The power button and heating lights will illuminate and the Keurig will make some noises while it heats up. When the three cup sizes illuminate in blue, you know it's time to brew your coffee. Set your coffee mug on top of the drip tray and lift the handle for the K-cup pod holder. Place a K-cup pod in the holder and lower the handle completely until the three cup sizes are blinking. The three sizes are: small cup (5.25 ounces), small mug (7.25 ounces) and large mug (9.25 ounces). Select your size and the coffee will be ready in about a minute. If the water reservoir is low on water, the \"add water\" light will illuminate and the process won't continue until you've filled the reservoir. Once it's stopped dripping, you may remove your mug and enjoy your coffee! If someone else wants to brew a cup of coffee right after yours is done, all they have to do is remove your K-cup pod since they are single-use pods, add theirs and repeat the process.  Water Reservoir: The reservoir holds 48 ounces of water so you don't have to fill it up every time you want to brew a new cup of coffee, which is one of the reasons I selected this model. I make about two cups of coffee every day so I end up refilling the reservoir every few days. There are filters to use with the water but I purchase bottled water so I haven't used the filters at this point. When the reservoir needs to be filled, I remove the reservoir, take off the lid, fill it up with water, place the reservoir back in the Keurig and replace the top.  Cleaning: I feel this Keurig is fairly simple to clean. The drip tray is removable and I usually wipe it down with a damp paper towel a couple times a week and wash it in water, soapy water occasionally. I also like to wipe down the exterior since the front part of the Keurig gets splatters of coffee on it. You can also clean the pod holder, funnel, needles and water reservoir and lid. Be careful as the two needles used to puncture holes in the K-cup pods are very sharp.  Coffee Pods (the best part!): The Keurig K55 Coffee Maker uses the K-cup pods, which you can purchase nearly everywhere and there are many brands and flavors to choose from. You don't need to buy any specific brand with this coffee maker. As long as they are K-cups, they should work and I haven't come across any pods that don't work. I've been having a lot of fun purchasing different flavors and brands since I have several friends and family members who also have Keurigs so it's a lot of fun to swap coffees! I prefer flavored coffees and there are so many out there to try but my favorites are the Green Mountain flavors in Caramel Vanilla Creme and Wild Mountain Blueberry. There are K-cup pods in different price ranges and it's nice to have that option since everyone has a different budget. The nice thing with this brewer is that the flavors don't tend to blend from one cup to the next. For instance, my mom and I have brewed cups of coffee one right after the other (different flavors) and neither of us have noticed the other flavor in our respective cups. I've only brewed one cup of apple cider with this and haven't noticed the previous coffee flavor in the apple cider or the apple cider in my next cup of coffee. In this brewer, you can use all kinds of coffee flavors from flavored to medium and dark roasts to hot chocolate to apple cider. I typically choose the small mug (7.25 ounces) setting since I like the flavor. It isn't too strong or too watered-down for me but others may prefer other settings.  Programmable Auto Off Timer: You can set the brewer to turn off two hours after the last cup of coffee has brewed (included in the instructions). I just turn the Keurig on and off as I need it but it's nice to have that option.  Noise: Some people have stated that this brewer is noisy. I've found it's the noisiest when it's taking water from the reservoir and it sounds like a loud hum. It's not too loud when it's brewing the cup of coffee. I occasionally get up earlier than my husband and kids and brew a cup of coffee and no one has woken up (I'd say there is about 30 feet between the kitchen and bedrooms with the doors closed). When we have guests and they brew coffee before I wake up, I can't hear it at all.  This Keurig is made in China and mine had a packaging date of August 2016, a month before I purchased it. I've been using it for two months and haven't had any problems with it at all. It measures about 12 inches deep (from front to back), nine inches wide (side to side) and 13 1/2 inches tall. I've had several family members use it and my parents and in-laws have found it fairly simple to use after I show them how to brew the coffee since we all have different models. Ever since I started drinking coffee, I've had better success with staying more alert and awake to take care of my twins and buying this Keurig has been well-worth every penny we spent on it! I have no regrets buying it and have been having a lot of fun finding different flavors to try. As with all of my reviews and especially any appliances and electronics reviews, I will periodically update this review, add in any new information I discover and adjust my thoughts and star rating, if needed. If you, or someone you know, is interested in a Keurig, I highly recommend this one. It's a great model that is nice on your wallet and will brew a great cup of coffee as often as you'd like!  ***Update 04/25/2017 - I've had this Keurig now for almost eight months and it's still working great for us! I typically brew four cups of coffee a day now to keep up with my kids and I've had no trouble with using this Keurig. When we have guests and are switching pods a lot, I never notice a strange taste at all (since we all like different flavors). I clean out the drip tray and wipe the whole machine down at least once a week to keep it looking nice. We only use bottled water in it so I've never had to use the filter. When we go away for a few days, I always wipe everything down and empty the water reservoir so it can air out and dry. I still highly recommend this Keurig if you want a good single-cup brewer that isn't incredibly expensive!",

                    "title": "One Week With My Keurig K55. I Love It!",
                    "body": "There are numerous detailed reviews of the Keurig K55 and other models on Amazon and I see no reason to repeat or refute other reviewers' opinions, so I'll limit my review to my impressions based on one week's use and experimentation with various coffees and other beverages that my wife and I have tried and enjoyed.  I don't consider myself to be a \"coffee snob\" but I drink a lot of coffee and insist on a good. fresh cup of coffee, properly brewed to my personal taste. For more than 20 years, I've used Saeco super automatic espresso/coffee machines such as this one:https://smile.amazon.com/Saeco-Philips-Intelia-Espresso-Machine/dp/B019771XIE/ref=sr_1_1?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1481465394&sr=1-1&keywords=saeco+super+automatic+espresso+machine&refinements=p_89%3ASaeco ranging in cost from about $600 to $2,500 depending on the model. These super automatic machines allow you to load whole bean coffee of your choice into a hopper and at the push of a button, it grinds the beans, loads them into the brew unit, dispenses the coffee, then dumps the used grounds and is ready to brew another cup at the touch of a button. They are completely adjustable so you can brew your coffee as strong as you like, from espresso to fairly weak American-style coffee. They also have a steamer which allows you to make cappuccino and other coffee beverages. I love these machines and they make great coffee, but they have disadvantages. First, because you have to load the whole beans in the hopper, it isn't easy to change to a different coffee if other family members drink decaf, for example, or prefer lighter or darker roasts. Also, they only brew coffees, no other beverages. Lastly, they are complicated and require quite a bit of maintenance.  Enter the Keurig K55, which is their least expensive basic model but does everything I expect. I purchased it for my wife who likes to drink my lighter coffee as well as various teas, hot chocolate, cider, etc. My thought was to let her use the Keurig and to continue making my coffee in my Saeco but I've found that the Keurig makes very good coffee and suspect that my Saeco will be retired because the Keurig is so much more convenient to use and maintain and I'm completely satisfied with the coffee I'm brewing in it, perhaps not quite as \"great\" as that I make in my Saeco more than satisfactory, and far superior to the coffee I buy in restaurants, donut shops and convenience stores.  I won't recommend particular k-cup coffee brands because there are so many of them and everyone has different preferences. One of the main advantages to the Keurig is that there are so many choices available, with three brew strength/ water level settings, as well as a great variety of other hot beverages such as black and herbal teas, hot chocolates, ciders, and more.  You can also buy reusable k-cup holders and any ground coffee you like. This may save a little money and also allows you to choose your favorite coffee even if it isn't available in K-cups. I ordered a set of these reusable k-cups and have tried them with several ground coffees, comparing them to the prefilled k-cup versions of the same coffees. The k-cup ones are as good or better than the ones I've loaded myself using the reusable k-cups and are SO MUCH easier and more convenient to use. They're a little more expensive but still reasonably priced, particularly if you buy them in bulk from Amazon, Sam's Club, etc., or find them on sale at your local supermarket. On average, I'm paying less around 40 cents a pod for mine. Other k-cup beverages such as teas and hot chocolate tend to be less expensive than the premium coffees I buy.  The real advantages to the Keurig are convenience, ease of use and the variety of coffees and beverages you can make with it, including iced teas and other iced beverages. My wife and I can share a single machine and make our own preferred beverages quickly and easily. After she makes a flavored beverage, I simply run a shot of hot water through the machine to remove any off-taste before brewing my coffee.  Although I won't recommend specific brands due to personal tastes, I will mention that I prefer well-balanced, slightly acidic medium to medium dark roasts. I don't like breakfast blends or other light roasts, nor do I like really dark roasts such as those typical of some coffee shops such as Starbucks, although I have tried some of the dark roasts from Starbucks k-cups and others and they are fine, just not to my taste. I usually use the medium water level (7.25 oz) setting. Depending on the coffee I'm using, this usually gives me a rich, well-balanced, fairly strong cup of coffee. For some lighter roast coffees I prefer the low (5.25 oz) setting. My wife doesn't like strong coffee and usually uses the high (7.25 oz) setting. Teas, ciders and hot chocolate usually taste better with the high water level setting.  If you are considering giving the Keurig a try, I recommend that you consider buying one of the many sampler k-cup packs available on Amazon. Some are coffee only and others include assorted flavored coffee, cappuccino, tea, hot chocolate, cider, etc. The one I bought is this one: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KSIE39I/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 . It was a good choice and my wife and I quickly discovered our favorites. We've also bought a few others to try (on sale) at my local supermarket. All were good, even though some weren't to my personal taste. Once you decide on your favorites and the brew strength you prefer, you're all set to make good, fresh coffee and other k-cup beverages easily and conveniently.  I mentioned at the beginning of my review that I'm not a \"coffee snob\" but I do insist on good fresh coffee, brewed to my personal taste. The Keurig accomplishes this. I realize that many people ARE purists (coffee snobs, in my parlance). If so, you probably won't like the Keurig but for 95% of all coffee drinkers, the Keurig is great. I'm more than willing to give up my \"perfect\" cup for one that's almost as good and so much easier and more convenient to brew, not to mention all of the other beverages it will make.  I can see why the Keurig has become so popular. It fully deserves the five star rating I've given it. I highly recommend it to most coffee drinkers. I'm less convinced that it's the best solution to brew tea. It's okay but I still think it's worth the effort to brew tea by steeping it (using the Keurig to dispense hot water for brewing it if you wish). However, K-cup hot tea and iced teas aren't bad and are certainly quick and easy.",

                    "title": "Well-Designed with Superior Performance -The Very Best Coffee Maker That We Have Owned In 40 Years",
                    "body": "The media could not be loaded. In the forty years of our marriage, we have owned several well-known brands of coffee makers. However, we feel that the Keurig K55 coffee maker has proved superior to any of our previous coffee brewers.  Last year I invested in our first Keurig coffee maker, and I chose the K15 for individual servings. This worked out so well that a few months later, I bought another for my office and I loved my second Keurig as much as I loved the first one. Then last winter I decided to purchase another Keurig, only a different model that would accommodate several servings.  I bought the K55 model because it has various featured options. This includes offering the choice for different hot beverages without the extra step to refill the tank each time with water, and this is due to the larger 48 oz. water reservoir. In addition, this enables us to make a variety of hot beverages in rapid succession, within a few seconds instead of waiting for all the water to reheat. Furthermore, the Keurig K55 offers a personal ‘custom tailored’ brew by letting us determine the strength of our coffee, and we have a choice of three. The smallest amount for a 6 oz. provides the strongest brew and the other two servings are an 8 and 10 oz.  I like strong coffee, or sometimes I like to have flavored coffee, and my sister-in-law likes the same coffee that I do. My husband prefers a milder brew, and he never drinks flavored coffee. My son drinks tea, and likes to try different varieties and my grandson loves sampling different selections of hot chocolate.  The Keurig K55 has a fast set-up, with easy to follow and systematic directions from the manual. It offers us a variety ways to make coffee, tea or just to heat water and all without any major modifications, because it just goes from one task to another.  Below are some of the general features, and all are well designed and ‘user friendly’.  CONTROL PANEL:  All the controls are on the top right of the coffee maker and I like the flat slope surface that slightly slants down toward my eye level, and therefore, I don’t need to step on my tiptoes to read the buttons.  On the panel, there are 5 press buttons and each one has an LED light to reduce ‘user error’.  Power: Green LED Auto Off: Green LED - (this is the automatic timer and when activated will automatically power off after 2 hours). 3 Brew Size Servings – corresponding size to the serving size and each with a Blue LED a. Cup Size - yields 6 oz. – which will provide the strongest brew b. Small Mug - produces 8 oz. c. Large Mug – dispenses 10 oz.  Aside from the 5 press buttons to regulate the Keurig coffee maker, there are 3 other LED light indicators.  1. Add Water – a Blue LED will light up If there is not enough water, the coffee maker will not work, therefore I consider this indicator as a safety feature, as well as a resolution to a possible ‘user error’.  2. Descale – will light up with a Red LED light This is another handy feature, to indicate necessary cleaning maintenance.  3. Heating – while the water is heating, a red LED powers on, and then powers off when the water is hot and ready for a brew.  WATER RESERVOIR:  Included with the Keurig K55 is a Charcoal Water filter Cartridge Kit with 2 charcoal filters. This will eliminate the unwanted chemical taste that is in some water systems, and good tasting water is essential for a delicious cup of coffee. The recommended life span for each charcoal filter is approximately 2 months or 60 ‘full-tank’ refills. There are several selections for Replacement Charcoal Filter-Pods available on Amazon.com.  The water reservoir attached to the left side is easy to remove with a slight lift up and outward motion. It fits inside a base and the tank is easy to remove and replace without any struggle. Alternatively, remove the reservoir tank cover, and pour water in from a bottle or a container.  DRIP TRAY: This is much more than ‘just a drip tray’, under the cover is a 1” deep receptacle that will accommodate 8 oz. of a liquid spillover. Therefore, if the user makes an error and pushes the wrong brew amount for a smaller cup, this will save the kitchen counters and the floor from a major flood. In addition, this coffee maker will accommodate my 7 ¼” coffee thermos by sliding the drip tray out from bottom base, and I can have my thermos filled when placed on the bottom flat tray base.  THE KEURIG K55 ACCOMMODATES REUSABLE COFFEE FILTERS:  My favorite coffee is from fresh beans that I grind myself, and therefore it’s important to me that a coffee maker will accommodate a reusable filter. The K-Cup pod holder on the K55 is very easy to remove and it literally takes less than 10 seconds. Just tap the bottom of the pod holder with a finger and the K-Cup holder slides out with ease. The reusable K-cup filter then slides in place within the groove, and works with perfection for a delicious cup of fresh ground beans, or any ground coffee.  The reusable coffer pod filter that I use is the Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter (Single) – and this is compatible with the Keurig K55 model.  I purchased this from Amazon last spring, and in addition, I use this same filter with my Keurig K15. https://www.amazon.com/Keurig-5048-Reusable-Coffee-Filter/dp/B000DLB2FI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1486296530&sr=8-1&keywords=Keurig+My+K-Cup+Reusable+Coffee+Filter+%28Single%29  In conclusion, the Keurig K55 is a well thought-out designed coffee maker, with user-friendly features. This machine comes with a ‘Charcoal Water Filter Cartridge Kit and 2 charcoal pod filters, which guarantees excellent coffee, even though we have ‘hard water’ (which tastes awful) in our water system. In addition, I love that Keurig does NOT use a breakable glass carafe, which was the thing that broke most often with our previous coffee makers.",

We ordered this for my Aunt. WHY did the first 3 fail? Well Keurig fiiiiiinally told us that it was because we use a water softener! Didn't matter that we got it through the filter on the fridge or via the tap. They told us that softened water just gums up the Keurig. So WHY DON'T THEY MENTION THIS ANYWHERE IN THE USER GUIDE❓❓❓❓❓ Good question. It cost THEM 3 new machines. They told us to buy spring water--not distilled. So we have to buy gallons of spring water at the store and it's all fine. So if you're like us, and HAVE to use a water softener (we have extremely hard water here in the rocky southern Missouri Ozark mountains), then just buy spring waterto use. Then you can enjoy the coffee that this handy machine makes. Hopefully SOMEDAY Keurig will add this caution to their user guide. But for us, now we can enjoy our favorite coffees when we go visiting my awesome Aunt!",

    "bestFeaturesText": "Several customers shared positive comments about this product even in the instances where there were minor issues. The model's capacity to brew high-quality coffee daily was frequently highlighted, indicating that its function lasts and remains consistent. A feature most customers appreciated is the machine's reliability. Many users specified that they use their Keurig daily, with some stating that their previous Keurig lasted 12 years without failure, which showcases its exceptional durability. \n\nAnother point in favor is its portability resulting from its light weight, as reported by some customers. This quality can enhance the user experience as it's easier to manipulate when cleaning or relocating, making it a user-friendly model. \n\nAmazon's principle of price competitiveness was mentioned by one customer who pointed out that the best price for the product was available on Amazon. In a market saturated with various coffee maker models, this coffee maker's competitive price point adds to its overall value.\n\nThe product seems to please customers who are not heavy coffee drinkers but enjoy a cup or two a day. Such moderate use seems to be ideal for this model's lifespan and function. Potential customers must note that these insights do not guarantee that their experiences would be the same but give a well-rounded representation of the product's strengths.",
    "problemsText": "The critical problems reported by customers regarding their Keurig coffee makers include issues with the water reservoir, machine malfunctions, difficulty filling cups, missing parts, lack of heated water, and frequent descaling needs. Although some customers have found solutions such as using parts from their previous machines or dealing with circuit breaker issues, many still experience inconvenience due to these issues.\n\nSolution-wise, Keurig could improve their quality control to ensure all components are included with the machines. In addition, upgrading the water reservoir to a larger size could address visibility and refill frequency issues. Heated water could be addressed by altering the design to ensure a constant temperature is maintained. As for machine malfunctions, a more rigorous testing and servicing process could prevent breakdowns. Concerning the descaling issue, buyers should be provided with clear and concise instructions on how to descale the machine properly, as well as how often to do it.\n\nPotential buyers should weigh these issues against their specific coffee brewing needs and preferences. Keurig should address these concerns transparently to enhance customers' confidence before making a purchase. It's also critical for customers to understand the product return policies to mitigate any potential return process issues.\n",

                    "title": "This Keurig is My Favorite Kitchen Appliance and It's Well-Worth the Money We Spent!",
                    "body": "***Updates are located at the bottom of this review.***  ***Original Review*** Up until recently, I had never been much of a coffee drinker except for the occasional seasonal flavored latte drinks but I was having trouble keeping up with my very active twin toddlers. We already had a standard coffee maker but I didn't want to brew a whole pot of coffee at once and single-serve coffee makers seem to be very popular so I figured it couldn't hurt to give it a try. I had seen several different Keurigs from the basic ones to very fancy ones but wanted to purchase one that both fulfilled my needs to brew a single cup of coffee and wasn't too expensive so I opted to buy the Keurig K55 Coffee Maker in black.  When the Keurig arrived, I eagerly opened up the box to get it set up and start using it! I found it fairly simple to set up since there is a Use and Care Guide included and it's easy to follow the step-by-step instructions. I'd say the setup only takes a few minutes and then you are ready to brew your first cup of coffee. There are lights on the brewer that illuminate and walk you through the brewing process but once you are used to it, it becomes second nature and now, I don't even have to think about it, which is good in the early morning when I'm not thinking straight and need my coffee!  Brewing: To brew a cup of coffee is very simple. You'll need to turn on the brewer by pushing the power button. The power button and heating lights will illuminate and the Keurig will make some noises while it heats up. When the three cup sizes illuminate in blue, you know it's time to brew your coffee. Set your coffee mug on top of the drip tray and lift the handle for the K-cup pod holder. Place a K-cup pod in the holder and lower the handle completely until the three cup sizes are blinking. The three sizes are: small cup (5.25 ounces), small mug (7.25 ounces) and large mug (9.25 ounces). Select your size and the coffee will be ready in about a minute. If the water reservoir is low on water, the \"add water\" light will illuminate and the process won't continue until you've filled the reservoir. Once it's stopped dripping, you may remove your mug and enjoy your coffee! If someone else wants to brew a cup of coffee right after yours is done, all they have to do is remove your K-cup pod since they are single-use pods, add theirs and repeat the process.  Water Reservoir: The reservoir holds 48 ounces of water so you don't have to fill it up every time you want to brew a new cup of coffee, which is one of the reasons I selected this model. I make about two cups of coffee every day so I end up refilling the reservoir every few days. There are filters to use with the water but I purchase bottled water so I haven't used the filters at this point. When the reservoir needs to be filled, I remove the reservoir, take off the lid, fill it up with water, place the reservoir back in the Keurig and replace the top.  Cleaning: I feel this Keurig is fairly simple to clean. The drip tray is removable and I usually wipe it down with a damp paper towel a couple times a week and wash it in water, soapy water occasionally. I also like to wipe down the exterior since the front part of the Keurig gets splatters of coffee on it. You can also clean the pod holder, funnel, needles and water reservoir and lid. Be careful as the two needles used to puncture holes in the K-cup pods are very sharp.  Coffee Pods (the best part!): The Keurig K55 Coffee Maker uses the K-cup pods, which you can purchase nearly everywhere and there are many brands and flavors to choose from. You don't need to buy any specific brand with this coffee maker. As long as they are K-cups, they should work and I haven't come across any pods that don't work. I've been having a lot of fun purchasing different flavors and brands since I have several friends and family members who also have Keurigs so it's a lot of fun to swap coffees! I prefer flavored coffees and there are so many out there to try but my favorites are the Green Mountain flavors in Caramel Vanilla Creme and Wild Mountain Blueberry. There are K-cup pods in different price ranges and it's nice to have that option since everyone has a different budget. The nice thing with this brewer is that the flavors don't tend to blend from one cup to the next. For instance, my mom and I have brewed cups of coffee one right after the other (different flavors) and neither of us have noticed the other flavor in our respective cups. I've only brewed one cup of apple cider with this and haven't noticed the previous coffee flavor in the apple cider or the apple cider in my next cup of coffee. In this brewer, you can use all kinds of coffee flavors from flavored to medium and dark roasts to hot chocolate to apple cider. I typically choose the small mug (7.25 ounces) setting since I like the flavor. It isn't too strong or too watered-down for me but others may prefer other settings.  Programmable Auto Off Timer: You can set the brewer to turn off two hours after the last cup of coffee has brewed (included in the instructions). I just turn the Keurig on and off as I need it but it's nice to have that option.  Noise: Some people have stated that this brewer is noisy. I've found it's the noisiest when it's taking water from the reservoir and it sounds like a loud hum. It's not too loud when it's brewing the cup of coffee. I occasionally get up earlier than my husband and kids and brew a cup of coffee and no one has woken up (I'd say there is about 30 feet between the kitchen and bedrooms with the doors closed). When we have guests and they brew coffee before I wake up, I can't hear it at all.  This Keurig is made in China and mine had a packaging date of August 2016, a month before I purchased it. I've been using it for two months and haven't had any problems with it at all. It measures about 12 inches deep (from front to back), nine inches wide (side to side) and 13 1/2 inches tall. I've had several family members use it and my parents and in-laws have found it fairly simple to use after I show them how to brew the coffee since we all have different models. Ever since I started drinking coffee, I've had better success with staying more alert and awake to take care of my twins and buying this Keurig has been well-worth every penny we spent on it! I have no regrets buying it and have been having a lot of fun finding different flavors to try. As with all of my reviews and especially any appliances and electronics reviews, I will periodically update this review, add in any new information I discover and adjust my thoughts and star rating, if needed. If you, or someone you know, is interested in a Keurig, I highly recommend this one. It's a great model that is nice on your wallet and will brew a great cup of coffee as often as you'd like!  ***Update 04/25/2017 - I've had this Keurig now for almost eight months and it's still working great for us! I typically brew four cups of coffee a day now to keep up with my kids and I've had no trouble with using this Keurig. When we have guests and are switching pods a lot, I never notice a strange taste at all (since we all like different flavors). I clean out the drip tray and wipe the whole machine down at least once a week to keep it looking nice. We only use bottled water in it so I've never had to use the filter. When we go away for a few days, I always wipe everything down and empty the water reservoir so it can air out and dry. I still highly recommend this Keurig if you want a good single-cup brewer that isn't incredibly expensive!",

For more than 20 years, I've used Saeco super automatic espresso/coffee machines such as this one:https://smile.amazon.com/Saeco-Philips-Intelia-Espresso-Machine/dp/B019771XIE/ref=sr_1_1?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1481465394&sr=1-1&keywords=saeco+super+automatic+espresso+machine&refinements=p_89%3ASaeco ranging in cost from about $600 to $2,500 depending on the model. These super automatic machines allow you to load whole bean coffee of your choice into a hopper and at the push of a button, it grinds the beans, loads them into the brew unit, dispenses the coffee, then dumps the used grounds and is ready to brew another cup at the touch of a button. They are completely adjustable so you can brew your coffee as strong as you like, from espresso to fairly weak American-style coffee. They also have a steamer which allows you to make cappuccino and other coffee beverages. I love these machines and they make great coffee, but they have disadvantages. First, because you have to load the whole beans in the hopper, it isn't easy to change to a different coffee if other family members drink decaf, for example, or prefer lighter or darker roasts. Also, they only brew coffees, no other beverages. Lastly, they are complicated and require quite a bit of maintenance.  Enter the Keurig K55, which is their least expensive basic model but does everything I expect. I purchased it for my wife who likes to drink my lighter coffee as well as various teas, hot chocolate, cider, etc. My thought was to let her use the Keurig and to continue making my coffee in my Saeco but I've found that the Keurig makes very good coffee and suspect that my Saeco will be retired because the Keurig is so much more convenient to use and maintain and I'm completely satisfied with the coffee I'm brewing in it, perhaps not quite as \"great\" as that I make in my Saeco more than satisfactory, and far superior to the coffee I buy in restaurants, donut shops and convenience stores.  I won't recommend particular k-cup coffee brands because there are so many of them and everyone has different preferences. One of the main advantages to the Keurig is that there are so many choices available, with three brew strength/ water level settings, as well as a great variety of other hot beverages such as black and herbal teas, hot chocolates, ciders, and more.  You can also buy reusable k-cup holders and any ground coffee you like. This may save a little money and also allows you to choose your favorite coffee even if it isn't available in K-cups. I ordered a set of these reusable k-cups and have tried them with several ground coffees, comparing them to the prefilled k-cup versions of the same coffees. The k-cup ones are as good or better than the ones I've loaded myself using the reusable k-cups and are SO MUCH easier and more convenient to use. They're a little more expensive but still reasonably priced, particularly if you buy them in bulk from Amazon, Sam's Club, etc., or find them on sale at your local supermarket. On average, I'm paying less around 40 cents a pod for mine. Other k-cup beverages such as teas and hot chocolate tend to be less expensive than the premium coffees I buy.  The real advantages to the Keurig are convenience, ease of use and the variety of coffees and beverages you can make with it, including iced teas and other iced beverages. My wife and I can share a single machine and make our own preferred beverages quickly and easily. After she makes a flavored beverage, I simply run a shot of hot water through the machine to remove any off-taste before brewing my coffee.  Although I won't recommend specific brands due to personal tastes, I will mention that I prefer well-balanced, slightly acidic medium to medium dark roasts. I don't like breakfast blends or other light roasts, nor do I like really dark roasts such as those typical of some coffee shops such as Starbucks, although I have tried some of the dark roasts from Starbucks k-cups and others and they are fine, just not to my taste. I usually use the medium water level (7.25 oz) setting. Depending on the coffee I'm using, this usually gives me a rich, well-balanced, fairly strong cup of coffee. For some lighter roast coffees I prefer the low (5.25 oz) setting. My wife doesn't like strong coffee and usually uses the high (7.25 oz) setting. Teas, ciders and hot chocolate usually taste better with the high water level setting.  If you are considering giving the Keurig a try, I recommend that you consider buying one of the many sampler k-cup packs available on Amazon. Some are coffee only and others include assorted flavored coffee, cappuccino, tea, hot chocolate, cider, etc. The one I bought is this one: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KSIE39I/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 . It was a good choice and my wife and I quickly discovered our favorites. We've also bought a few others to try (on sale) at my local supermarket. All were good, even though some weren't to my personal taste. Once you decide on your favorites and the brew strength you prefer, you're all set to make good, fresh coffee and other k-cup beverages easily and conveniently.  I mentioned at the beginning of my review that I'm not a \"coffee snob\" but I do insist on good fresh coffee, brewed to my personal taste. The Keurig accomplishes this. I realize that many people ARE purists (coffee snobs, in my parlance). If so, you probably won't like the Keurig but for 95% of all coffee drinkers, the Keurig is great. I'm more than willing to give up my \"perfect\" cup for one that's almost as good and so much easier and more convenient to brew, not to mention all of the other beverages it will make.  I can see why the Keurig has become so popular. It fully deserves the five star rating I've given it. I highly recommend it to most coffee drinkers. I'm less convinced that it's the best solution to brew tea. It's okay but I still think it's worth the effort to brew tea by steeping it (using the Keurig to dispense hot water for brewing it if you wish). However, K-cup hot tea and iced teas aren't bad and are certainly quick and easy.",

                    "title": "Well-Designed with Superior Performance -The Very Best Coffee Maker That We Have Owned In 40 Years",
                    "body": "The media could not be loaded. In the forty years of our marriage, we have owned several well-known brands of coffee makers. However, we feel that the Keurig K55 coffee maker has proved superior to any of our previous coffee brewers.  Last year I invested in our first Keurig coffee maker, and I chose the K15 for individual servings. This worked out so well that a few months later, I bought another for my office and I loved my second Keurig as much as I loved the first one. Then last winter I decided to purchase another Keurig, only a different model that would accommodate several servings.  I bought the K55 model because it has various featured options. This includes offering the choice for different hot beverages without the extra step to refill the tank each time with water, and this is due to the larger 48 oz. water reservoir. In addition, this enables us to make a variety of hot beverages in rapid succession, within a few seconds instead of waiting for all the water to reheat. Furthermore, the Keurig K55 offers a personal ‘custom tailored’ brew by letting us determine the strength of our coffee, and we have a choice of three. The smallest amount for a 6 oz. provides the strongest brew and the other two servings are an 8 and 10 oz.  I like strong coffee, or sometimes I like to have flavored coffee, and my sister-in-law likes the same coffee that I do. My husband prefers a milder brew, and he never drinks flavored coffee. My son drinks tea, and likes to try different varieties and my grandson loves sampling different selections of hot chocolate.  The Keurig K55 has a fast set-up, with easy to follow and systematic directions from the manual. It offers us a variety ways to make coffee, tea or just to heat water and all without any major modifications, because it just goes from one task to another.  Below are some of the general features, and all are well designed and ‘user friendly’.  CONTROL PANEL:  All the controls are on the top right of the coffee maker and I like the flat slope surface that slightly slants down toward my eye level, and therefore, I don’t need to step on my tiptoes to read the buttons.  On the panel, there are 5 press buttons and each one has an LED light to reduce ‘user error’.  Power: Green LED Auto Off: Green LED - (this is the automatic timer and when activated will automatically power off after 2 hours). 3 Brew Size Servings – corresponding size to the serving size and each with a Blue LED a. Cup Size - yields 6 oz. – which will provide the strongest brew b. Small Mug - produces 8 oz. c. Large Mug – dispenses 10 oz.  Aside from the 5 press buttons to regulate the Keurig coffee maker, there are 3 other LED light indicators.  1. Add Water – a Blue LED will light up If there is not enough water, the coffee maker will not work, therefore I consider this indicator as a safety feature, as well as a resolution to a possible ‘user error’.  2. Descale – will light up with a Red LED light This is another handy feature, to indicate necessary cleaning maintenance.  3. Heating – while the water is heating, a red LED powers on, and then powers off when the water is hot and ready for a brew.  WATER RESERVOIR:  Included with the Keurig K55 is a Charcoal Water filter Cartridge Kit with 2 charcoal filters. This will eliminate the unwanted chemical taste that is in some water systems, and good tasting water is essential for a delicious cup of coffee. The recommended life span for each charcoal filter is approximately 2 months or 60 ‘full-tank’ refills. There are several selections for Replacement Charcoal Filter-Pods available on Amazon.com.  The water reservoir attached to the left side is easy to remove with a slight lift up and outward motion. It fits inside a base and the tank is easy to remove and replace without any struggle. Alternatively, remove the reservoir tank cover, and pour water in from a bottle or a container.  DRIP TRAY: This is much more than ‘just a drip tray’, under the cover is a 1” deep receptacle that will accommodate 8 oz. of a liquid spillover. Therefore, if the user makes an error and pushes the wrong brew amount for a smaller cup, this will save the kitchen counters and the floor from a major flood. In addition, this coffee maker will accommodate my 7 ¼” coffee thermos by sliding the drip tray out from bottom base, and I can have my thermos filled when placed on the bottom flat tray base.  THE KEURIG K55 ACCOMMODATES REUSABLE COFFEE FILTERS:  My favorite coffee is from fresh beans that I grind myself, and therefore it’s important to me that a coffee maker will accommodate a reusable filter. The K-Cup pod holder on the K55 is very easy to remove and it literally takes less than 10 seconds. Just tap the bottom of the pod holder with a finger and the K-Cup holder slides out with ease. The reusable K-cup filter then slides in place within the groove, and works with perfection for a delicious cup of fresh ground beans, or any ground coffee.  The reusable coffer pod filter that I use is the Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter (Single) – and this is compatible with the Keurig K55 model.  I purchased this from Amazon last spring, and in addition, I use this same filter with my Keurig K15. https://www.amazon.com/Keurig-5048-Reusable-Coffee-Filter/dp/B000DLB2FI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1486296530&sr=8-1&keywords=Keurig+My+K-Cup+Reusable+Coffee+Filter+%28Single%29  In conclusion, the Keurig K55 is a well thought-out designed coffee maker, with user-friendly features. This machine comes with a ‘Charcoal Water Filter Cartridge Kit and 2 charcoal pod filters, which guarantees excellent coffee, even though we have ‘hard water’ (which tastes awful) in our water system. In addition, I love that Keurig does NOT use a breakable glass carafe, which was the thing that broke most often with our previous coffee makers.",

Didn't matter that we got it through the filter on the fridge or via the tap. They told us that softened water just gums up the Keurig. So WHY DON'T THEY MENTION THIS ANYWHERE IN THE USER GUIDE❓❓❓❓❓ Good question. It cost THEM 3 new machines. They told us to buy spring water--not distilled. So we have to buy gallons of spring water at the store and it's all fine. So if you're like us, and HAVE to use a water softener (we have extremely hard water here in the rocky southern Missouri Ozark mountains), then just buy spring waterto use. Then you can enjoy the coffee that this handy machine makes. Hopefully SOMEDAY Keurig will add this caution to their user guide. But for us, now we can enjoy our favorite coffees when we go visiting my awesome Aunt!",

    "bestFeaturesText": "Customers have highlighted several positive aspects of the Nektek foot massager. There is appreciation for its easy usage and customizable features allowing for a more personalized massage experience. The range of modes and various temperature settings received praise for their effectiveness in providing soothing pain relief, particularly after long periods of standing or working. The quality of the product is also mentioned as impressive, owing to its sturdiness and competence in providing foot therapy. Further, it has been labeled as a worthwhile investment by many customers. Despite its compact size, it provides adequate relaxation, even for larger feet. One major highlight noted by customers is the company’s prompt customer service and their offers for assistance or an alternative model in case of unsatisfactory experience. They are proactive in resolving issues, ensuring customer satisfaction. However, customers also mentioned certain areas for improvement such as the inclusion of a remote for added convenience and the addition of a heel massaging function. Customers' individual preferences, foot size, and pain threshold may factor into the effectiveness and comfort of using the massager. Despite these, customers overall recommend the Nektek foot massager for its functional capabilities and therapeutic aid.",
    "problemsText": "Customers have provided valuable feedback about the foot massager. Though many recognised its effectiveness in providing foot therapy and pain relief, some faced challenges related to size, comfort, convenience, and intensity. A range of foot sizes from small to size 11 found discomfort, either due to sock liner size or pressure intensity, suggesting that the product's adaptability needs improvements. A possible solution could entail adjustable settings to accommodate different foot sizes and variable pressure levels. Some felt the air compression was too harsh on swollen feet, indicating the need for a sensitive setting tailored for inflammation conditions. There were also considerations about the product's weight, as some found it hard to move across rooms. A lighter, more portable design could overcome this issue. Finally, another potential addition could be the inclusion of a remote control for easier operation. While some reviews lacked explicit critical problems, it would be beneficial for future purchasers to take these aspects into account.",
